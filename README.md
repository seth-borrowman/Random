# Random
- qPCR_Template.qmd
  - Takes a .xls file exported from QuantStudio as input. Outputs a PDF plotting a standard curve with statistics and predicted copy \#'s for unknown samples as well as a .csv containing data for all replicates.
  - Download, install Quarto from here: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/
  - In R Studio: Update header with title, name, etc. Update input_file with a .xls file path (eg. "D:/filename.xls"). Install any missing packages. Click "Render" (Ctrl+Shif+K on Windows).
- fastaRegexRemove.py
  - Can quickly trim sample names in a fasta by removing part of the name matching a regular expression.
  - Takes an input fasta (-i), a regular expression (-r), a string to replace the regex (-n, default=''), and a name for the output fasta (-o).
  - I recommend [this site](https://regex-generator.olafneumann.org/) to easily generate regex.
- filterFastaSamples.py
  - Filters fasta files by read/sample names.
  - Takes an input fasta (-i), a file with a record name to keep on each line (-l), and an optional name for the output (-o, default: filtered.fasta)
  - Not great with large (>500,000 samples) fasta files - may receive bus error.
- filter_fasta/
  - An attempt to 'oxidize' filterFastaSamples.py (convert it to Rust)
  - Can be compiled by cloneing or downloading the file and using <code>cargo build --release</code> inside the filter_fasta folder
    - Run with <code>./target/release/filter_fasta -i [input.fasta] -l [sample_list] -o [output.fasta]</code>
    - Check file name before running - may change with operating system (eg filter_fasta.exe on Windows)
  - Would like to add parallelization eventually.
